# Area_Shape_Calculator

This Python program is a simple shape area calculator. It allows you to calculate the areas of various geometric shapes. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface that prompts you to choose a shape and input the required dimensions. 

## Features

- Calculate the area of:
  - Rectangle
  - Square
  - Triangle
  - Circle
  - Hexagon
- Supports specialized area calculations for each shape
- User-friendly command-line interface
- Provides accurate area calculations based on the input dimensions

## How to Use

1. Run the program by executing the script in a Python environment.
2. The program will display a menu that allows you to select the shape for which you want to calculate the area.
3. Choose a shape by entering the corresponding number (1-5), or exit the program by entering 6.
4. If you select a shape, you will be prompted to input the required dimensions.
5. The program will calculate the area and display it on the screen.
6. You can calculate areas for multiple shapes in a single program run.

## Supported Shapes

1. Rectangle: Enter the length and breadth of the rectangle to calculate its area.

2. Square: Input the side length of the square to calculate its area.

3. Triangle: Provide the base and height of the triangle to calculate its area. Note that the triangle area is half the rectangle area with the same base and height.

4. Circle: Enter the circle's radius to calculate its area.

5. Hexagon: Input the side length of the hexagon to calculate its area using a specialized formula.

## Sample Usage

Here is an example of using the calculator to calculate the area of a square:

```
Which Shape size do you want to calculate 
1. Rectangle
2. Square
3. Triangle
4. Circle
5. Hexagon
6. Exit

Please select: 2
Enter side of Square: 4.5

The area of this Square is: 20.25
```
